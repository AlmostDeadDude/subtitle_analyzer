# SipScript

SipScript is a fun and interactive tool that enhances your movie nights by turning any film into a personalized drinking game. Upload subtitles, and let SipScript identify frequently repeated words.

## Getting Started

### Local Usage
The `main` branch calls the Python backend on your machine.

### API Usage
There is also the `API-backend-version` branch. This version calls an API endpoint instead. Normally works much slower. The website uses this version.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Subtitles:** Select a movie's subtitles file.
2. **Discover Repeat Words:** SipScript identifies words repeated throughout the movie.
3. **Have fun:** Customize your experience by choosing the best words for your movie night.
