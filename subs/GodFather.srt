1
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,024
I believe in America.

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,190
America has made my fortune...

3
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:57,697
and I raised my daughter in the American fashion.

4
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,263
I give her freedom, but I taught her...

5
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:04,093
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:07,861
She found a boyfriend. Not an Italian.

7
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,158
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:14,493
She stayed out late. I didn't protest.

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,064
Two months ago, he took her for a drive...

10
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,097
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,296
They made her drink whiskey...

12
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:27,632
and then they tried to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,225
She resisted.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,593
She kept her honor.

15
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:32,393
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:32,795
When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken...

17
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:34,126
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,789
held together by wire.

19
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,831
She couldn't even weep because of the pain.

20
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,189
But I wept. Why did I weep?

21
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:04,699
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:08,623
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,362
Now she will never be beautiful again.

24
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:23,359
Sorry.

25
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:35,426
I went to the police like a good American.

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,259
These two boys were brought to trial.

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,928
A judge sentence them to three years in prison...

28
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,760
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,958
Suspended sentence.

30
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:50,893
They went free that very day.

31
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:56,132
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

32
00:02:56,433 --> 00:03:00,126
And those two bastard, they smiled at me.

33
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:04,163
Then I said to my wife, For justice...

34
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,729
we must go to don Corleone.

35
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:16,164
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,095
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:22,427
Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,792
What is that?

39
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,232
That I cannot do.

40
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,957
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:58,132
We've known each other many
years, but this is the first time...

42
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,897
you ever came to me for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:06,061
I can't remember the last time that you invited me...

44
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,961
to your house for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:13,397
even though my wife is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,591
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,289
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,493
and you were afraid to be in my debt.

49
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,031
I didn't want to get into trouble.

50
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,356
I understand.

51
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,198
You found paradise in America.

52
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,133
You had a good trade, made a good living.

53
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,993
Police protected you, and there were courts of law.

54
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:42,427
So you didn't need a friend like me.

55
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:46,994
But now you come to me and you say...

56
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:50,361
don Corleone, give me justice.

57
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:54,165
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,960
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:00,066
You don't even think to call me Godfather.

60
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,293
Instead, you come into my house...

61
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,965
on the day my daughter is to be married...

62
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:07,632
and you ask me to do murder for money.

63
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,265
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:13,298
That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:18,730
They must suffer then as she suffers.

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,665
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,096
Bonier.

68
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:45,064
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:48,590
If you'd come to me in friendship...

70
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,424
then the scum that ruined your daughter...

71
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:53,123
would be suffering this very day.

72
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:55,163
And if, by chance...

73
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:57,425
an honest man like yourself should make enemies...

74
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:00,465
then they would become my enemies.

75
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:05,265
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,460
Be my friend?

77
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,865
Godfather.

78
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,030
Good.

79
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:26,329
Someday, and that day may never come...

80
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:29,796
I'll call upon you to do a service for me.

81
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:33,500
But until that day...

82
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,867
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,399
Grazie, Godfather.

84
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,194
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:54,866
I want reliable people...

86
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,091
people that aren't going to be carried away.

87
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,665
I mean, we're not murderers...

88
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,028
in spite of what this undertaker says.

89
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:28,059
- Where's Michael? - What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:30,167
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:31,266
We're not taking it.

92
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:34,162
We're not taking the picture without Michael.

93
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:43,025
- What's the matter, Sonny? - It's Michael.

94
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:34,298
Don Barzini.

95
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:53,930
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

96
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,431
Paulie! More wine.

97
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,201
Scusi, please.

98
00:08:58,335 --> 00:08:59,801
You look terrific on the floor.

99
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:00,492
What are you, a dance judge or something?

100
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:05,699
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

101
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:16,132
Sandra, come on. Do me a favor. Watch the kids.

102
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:20,201
- Don't let 'em run wild.
- You watch yourself, all right?

103
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,798
Twenty or thirty grand.

104
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:44,901
In small bills, cash.

105
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,057
In that little silk purse.

106
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:51,259
If this was somebody else's wedding.

107
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:54,495
Hey, Paulie! I got two gobbagool...

108
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,760
gabagol and a prosciutto.

109
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:59,128
Stupid jerk!

110
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,267
Hey, what's the matter?

111
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,391
Have to go back to work.

112
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:24,597
It's part of the wedding.

113
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:28,166
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

114
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,533
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful...

115
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,360
that you have invited me to your home...

116
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:45,264
Get outta here.

117
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:47,129
This is a private party. Go on.

118
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:50,530
What is it? Hey, my sister's wedding.

119
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:00,359
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothin'.

120
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:06,262
Hey, come here, come here. Come here!

121
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,063
There.

122
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:23,093
But towards the end he was paroled...

123
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,700
to help with the American war effort.

124
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:28,892
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

125
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,557
Nazorine, my friend, what can I do for you?

126
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,599
Now that the war is over...

127
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:37,065
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

128
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:39,962
Godfather, I have a daughter.

129
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:43,663
See, she and Enzo...

130
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,903
You want Enzo to stay in this country...

131
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:49,035
and you want your daughter to be married.

132
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,694
You understand everything.

133
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:55,598
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

134
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,867
And wait till you see the beautiful wedding cake...

135
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,194
I made for your daughter.

136
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,165
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

137
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:13,760
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

138
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:18,300
Give it to a Jew congressman in another district.

139
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,293
Who else is on the list?

140
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:30,060
Hey, Michael. How are you?

141
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:30,861
Hello.

142
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,193
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

143
00:12:58,004 --> 00:12:58,866
Is this necessary?

144
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:02,093
He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding...

145
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:03,928
so he wanted to thank you.

146
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,035
All right.

147
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:09,063
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful...

148
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,600
that you have invited me to your home...

149
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,461
on the wedding day of your daughter.

150
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:17,261
And may their first child be a masculine child.

151
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,765
- Don...
- Michael?

152
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:21,492
Don Corleone...

153
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,228
That man over there is talking to himself.

154
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,198
See that scary guy over there?

155
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:29,633
He's a very scary guy.

156
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:31,598
Who is he? What's his name?

157
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:33,735
His name is Luca Brasi...

158
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:37,230
and he helps my father out sometimes.

159
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:40,797
Wait a minute. He's coming over here.

160
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,067
You look terrific!

161
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:49,294
My brother Tom Hagen. This is Kay Adams.

162
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,627
How do you do? Nice to meet you.

163
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:54,594
Your father's been asking for you.

164
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:55,699
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

165
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,562
I'll be there.

166
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,729
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

167
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:04,027
When my brother Sonny was a kid...

168
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,531
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

169
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:10,570
So my father took him in...

170
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:14,299
and he's been with us ever since.

171
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,864
He's a good lawyer.

172
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,892
Not a Sicilian, but...

173
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,092
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

174
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,394
- What's that? - That's...

175
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:26,729
like a counselor, an advisor.

176
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:29,733
Very important to the family.

177
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,425
You like your lasagna?

178
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:41,235
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful...

179
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:45,335
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

180
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:53,565
on the day of your daughter's wedding.

181
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:56,499
And I hope that their first child...

182
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:59,500
be a masculine child.

183
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:05,403
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

184
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:09,266
For your daughter's bridal purse.

185
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:12,369
Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend.

186
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,593
Don Corleone, I'm gonna leave you now...

187
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:18,132
because I know you are busy.

188
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:20,462
Thank you.

189
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:27,037
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

190
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,497
but said you'd understand.

191
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:32,068
Also some of the judges.

192
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,333
They've all sent gifts.

193
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:39,061
What is that outside?

194
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,869
Johnny!

195
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,494
I love you.

196
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:04,034
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

197
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:07,029
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

198
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,998
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

199
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:12,137
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

200
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:17,934
Sing a song.

201
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,835
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

202
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:39,866
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

203
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,594
My father helped him with his career.

204
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:44,903
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

205
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,337
I have but one

206
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:50,299
- Let's listen to the song.
- No.

207
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:51,827
Heart

208
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,165
This heart I bring you

209
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:59,129
I have but one heart

210
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,200
To share with you

211
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:08,496
I have but one dream

212
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:13,268
That I can cling to

213
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:18,267
You are the one dream

214
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:22,703
I'll pray comes true

215
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:25,803
Please, Michael. Tell me.

216
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:29,404
My darling, until I saw you

217
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:30,799
When Johnny was first starting out...

218
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,163
he was signed to this personal service contract...

219
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,530
with a big bandleader.

220
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:39,465
And as his career got better and better...

221
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:41,797
he wanted to get out of it.

222
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:45,196
Now, Johnny is my father's godson...

223
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:48,493
and my father went to see this bandleader...

224
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:51,771
and he offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go.

225
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:54,929
But the bandleader said no.

226
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:58,695
So the next day my father went to see him...

227
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:01,697
only this time with Luca Brasi.

228
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:06,363
And within an hour, he signed a release...

229
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:11,499
for a certified check of $1,000.

230
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:14,399
How'd he do that?

231
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:17,093
My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

232
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:20,333
What was that?

233
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,937
Luca Brasi held a gun to his head...

234
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:25,396
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

235
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:28,969
or his signature would be on the contract.

236
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,833
That's a true story.

237
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:49,535
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

238
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:03,533
Beautiful!

239
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:12,031
My godson comes all the way from California.

240
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,497
Give him a glass of wine.

241
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:37,867
I'll take care of it.

242
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:43,304
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

243
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:52,768
How are you, Fredo?

244
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:56,166
My brother Fredo. This is Kay Adams.

245
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:58,298
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

246
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,564
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

247
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,803
Yeah. This is your friend, huh?

248
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:12,767
I don't know what to do. My voice is weak.

249
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:15,061
It's weak.

250
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:18,029
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture...

251
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,871
it puts me right back up on top again.

252
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:23,970
But this...

253
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:26,500
this man out there, he won't give it to me.

254
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:28,432
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

255
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:31,504
Woltz. He won't give it to me...

256
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:35,728
and he says there's no chance, no chance.

257
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,298
Sonny?

258
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,600
Sonny, you in there?

259
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,499
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

260
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,705
Yeah, one minute.

261
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:16,870
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

262
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,835
A best-seller.

263
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:21,165
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

264
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,805
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

265
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,700
Just be myself.

266
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,899
Oh, Godfather,
I don't know what to do.

267
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:34,305
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

268
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:35,864
Is this how you turned out?

269
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,563
A Hollywood finocchio that cries like a woman?

270
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:42,036
What can I do?

271
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:44,729
What is that nonsense?

272
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:47,095
Ridiculous!

273
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,905
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

274
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:55,931
Good.

275
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:58,037
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

276
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,262
can never be a real man.

277
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,029
Come here.

278
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:09,737
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

279
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:11,665
I want you to rest well, and a month from now...

280
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,203
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

281
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:18,032
Too late. They start shooting in a week.

282
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:21,561
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.

283
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:26,334
Now just go outside, enjoy yourself...

284
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:30,505
and forget about all this nonsense.

285
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:34,205
Listen. I want you to leave it all to me.

286
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,962
All right.

287
00:24:59,973 --> 00:25:02,665
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

288
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,101
In a few minutes, right after they cut the cake.

289
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,736
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

290
00:25:08,972 --> 00:25:11,166
Never. Give him a living...

291
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,998
but never discuss the family business with him.

292
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,500
What else?

293
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:17,105
Virgil Sollozzo called.

294
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,329
We have to give him a day sometime next week.

295
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:22,268
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

296
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,938
When am I going to California?

297
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:26,571
I want you to go tonight.

298
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,729
I want you to talk to this movie big shot...

299
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,134
and settle this business for Johnny.

300
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:36,266
If there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

301
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:42,104
Carlo, we're gonna take the picture.

302
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:45,099
Wait a minute.

303
00:25:45,306 --> 00:25:47,296
No, Michael, not me.

304
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:52,104
Just a little closer.

305
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:54,772
Okay, that's it. Just like that now. Hold it.

306
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:41,665
Isn't that nice?

307
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:48,569
All right, start talking.

308
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:51,339
I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane.

309
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:54,701
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

310
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,373
to Mr. Woltz if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

311
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:00,470
Woltz is listening.

312
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:04,068
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

313
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,801
And what favor would your friend...

314
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,767
grant Mr. Woltz?

315
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,133
You're gonna have some union problems.

316
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,238
My client could make them disappear.

317
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,100
Also, one of your top stars has just moved...

318
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:23,364
from marijuana to heroin.

319
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,333
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

320
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,802
Listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

321
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,472
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

322
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:32,605
Johnny Fontane will never get that movie.

323
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:34,669
I don't care how many dago, guinea, wop...

324
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,068
grease ball goombahs come outta the woodwork.

325
00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:38,466
I'm German-lrish.

326
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,128
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

327
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:43,773
I'll make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

328
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:45,667
I'm a lawyer. I have not threatened...

329
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,432
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who are you?

330
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:52,096
I have a special practice. I handle one client.

331
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,263
Now, you have my number. I'll wait for your call.

332
00:28:56,474 --> 00:28:59,032
By the way, I admire your pictures very much.

333
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:06,171
Check him out.

334
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,867
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

335
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,939
Used to decorate the palace of a king.

336
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,436
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

337
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,003
Why didn't you say you worked for Corleone, Tom?

338
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:40,140
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

339
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,272
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

340
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,668
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

341
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:46,432
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

342
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:49,266
Come with me. I want to show you
something really beautiful.

343
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:51,407
You do appreciate beauty, don't you, Tom?

344
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:57,972
There you are. $600,000 on four hooves.

345
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,163
I'll bet Russian czars...

346
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,966
never paid that kind of dough for a single horse.

347
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:04,230
Khartoum.

348
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:11,301
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

349
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:12,905
Beautiful.

350
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:14,801
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

351
00:30:14,974 --> 00:30:17,406
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

352
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,736
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

353
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:24,134
To the Italian people, that's a very religious...

354
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:26,399
sacred, close relationship.

355
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,904
I respect that.

356
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:30,300
Just tell him he should ask me anything else.

357
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:32,600
This is one favor I can't give him.

358
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:35,399
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

359
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,732
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

360
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:41,134
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

361
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:45,838
That part is perfect for him. It'll make him a big star.

362
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:47,967
I'm gonna run him out of the business.

363
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:49,902
Let me tell you why.

364
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:55,034
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

365
00:30:55,207 --> 00:30:57,071
most valuable proteges.

366
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,298
For five years, we had her under training.

367
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:02,497
Singing lessons, acting lessons, dancing lessons.

368
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,696
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her.

369
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:07,204
I was gonna make her a big star.

370
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,966
And let me be even more frank.

371
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:12,505
Just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man...

372
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:15,106
that it's not all dollars and cents.

373
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,799
She was beautiful.
She was young, she was innocent!

374
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:21,031
She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had...

375
00:31:21,274 --> 00:31:23,797
and I've had 'em all over the world!

376
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,564
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

377
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:29,765
with his olive oil voice
and guinea charm.

378
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:33,038
And she runs off.

379
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:37,597
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

380
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:40,203
and a man in my position can't afford...

381
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,102
to be made to look ridiculous!

382
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:45,500
Now you get the hell outta here!

383
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,401
And if that goombah tries any rough stuff...

384
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,402
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

385
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:54,605
Yeah. I heard that story.

386
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:57,868
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

387
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,700
If your car could take me
to the airport...

388
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:05,768
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

389
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:01,774
- You're not too tired, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

390
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,500
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

391
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,867
Now...

392
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,500
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

393
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:14,434
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

394
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:16,006
but only in matters of business...

395
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:18,766
with some sort of reasonable complaint.

396
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,837
His business is narcotics.

397
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:25,536
He has fields in Turkey where they grow the poppy...

398
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:29,436
and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.

399
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:33,264
Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...

400
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:35,374
for which he gives apiece of the action.

401
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,302
I couldn't find out how much.

402
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,269
The Tattaglia family is behind him here in New York.

403
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:42,339
Now, they have to be in it for something.

404
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:43,906
Santino Corleone.

405
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:45,598
What about his prison record?

406
00:34:45,776 --> 00:34:48,400
Two terms, one in Italy, one here.

407
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:51,269
He's known as a top narcotics man.

408
00:34:51,442 --> 00:34:54,465
Santino, what do you think?

409
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,001
There's a lot of money in that white powder.

410
00:34:58,441 --> 00:34:59,873
Tom?

411
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:02,372
I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...

412
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,201
than anything else we're looking at.

413
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:06,704
If we don't get into it, somebody else will.

414
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:08,840
Maybe one of the five families, maybe all of them.

415
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,632
With the money they earn...

416
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,340
they can buy more police and political power.

417
00:35:13,575 --> 00:35:15,542
Then they come after us.

418
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:18,038
Now we have the unions, we have the gambling...

419
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:20,803
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

420
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,134
is a thing of the future.

421
00:35:22,342 --> 00:35:23,967
If we don't get a piece of that action...

422
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:25,108
we risk everything we have.

423
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:28,207
Not now, but ten years from now.

424
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:35,907
So? What's your answer gonna be, Pop?

425
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:46,403
I need a man who has powerful friends.

426
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:48,905
I need a million dollars in cash.

427
00:35:49,842 --> 00:35:51,899
I need, don Corleone, those politicians...

428
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:56,132
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

429
00:35:57,142 --> 00:35:57,801
What is the interest for my family?

430
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,007
Thirty percent.

431
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:04,369
In the first year, your end
should be 3, 4 million dollars.

432
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:07,367
And then it would go up.

433
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:10,933
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

434
00:36:13,743 --> 00:36:16,174
My compliments.

435
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:22,605
I'll take care of the Tattaglias outta my share.

436
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:25,933
So, I receive 30% for finance...

437
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:29,506
political influence and legal protection.

438
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:32,665
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

439
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:37,702
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

440
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:40,568
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

441
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:42,867
just finance...

442
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:58,536
I said that I would see you because...

443
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:00,866
I heard that you were a serious man...

444
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:03,133
to be treated with respect.

445
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:11,737
But I must say no to you.

446
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:14,672
And I'll give you my reason.

447
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,271
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

448
00:37:19,342 --> 00:37:21,036
But they wouldn't be friendly very long...

449
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:23,731
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

450
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:27,033
which they regard as a harmless vice.

451
00:37:27,276 --> 00:37:29,605
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, don Corleone...

452
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:31,537
It doesn't make any difference to me...

453
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:34,573
what a man does for a living, you understand...

454
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:36,300
but your business is...

455
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:40,003
a little dangerous.

456
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,699
If you're worried about security for your million...

457
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:44,603
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

458
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:47,037
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

459
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:49,708
Wait a minute.

460
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,306
I have a sentimental weakness for my children...

461
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,971
and I spoil them, as you can see.

462
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:02,041
They talk when they should listen.

463
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,506
But anyway...

464
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:06,268
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final...

465
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:09,067
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

466
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:12,470
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

467
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:16,075
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

468
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:18,573
Thank you.

469
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:41,708
Come here.

470
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:46,108
What's the matter with you?

471
00:38:46,276 --> 00:38:47,969
I think your brain is going soft...

472
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:50,801
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

473
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,773
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

474
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,933
Go on.

475
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:04,404
Tom, what... What is this nonsense?

476
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,108
It's from Johnny. He's starring in that new film.

477
00:39:07,976 --> 00:39:10,999
Well, take it away.

478
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:13,602
Take it over there.

479
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:15,702
And...

480
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:19,098
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

481
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,235
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

482
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:30,807
I want you to find out what
he's got under his fingernails.

483
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:34,237
Go to the Tattaglias...

484
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,966
and make them think...

485
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,301
that you're not too happy with our family...

486
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,674
and find out what you can.

487
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:05,076
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

488
00:40:05,243 --> 00:40:07,107
and a tie for Freddy...

489
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,707
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

490
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:12,004
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

491
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,074
Oh, just you.

492
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:49,000
Tell Paulie to get the car. We're going.

493
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:50,402
Okay, Pa.

494
00:40:50,744 --> 00:40:53,336
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

495
00:40:56,443 --> 00:40:58,671
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

496
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:51,276
Luca, I am Bruno Tattaglia.

497
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:52,804
I know.

498
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,874
Scotch? Prewar.

499
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:03,905
You know who I am?

500
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:45,972
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

501
00:43:46,378 --> 00:43:49,072
I'm glad I run into you. I wanna talk to you.

502
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:50,902
I haven't got time.

503
00:43:51,177 --> 00:43:54,200
Oh, make time, consigliere. Get in the car.

504
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:57,409
What are you worried about?

505
00:44:00,643 --> 00:44:02,269
Get in.

506
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,940
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

507
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:24,837
Hi. Merry Christmas.

508
00:44:25,078 --> 00:44:27,043
I want some fruit over there.

509
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:32,606
Gimme three of them.

510
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,501
No, that one.

511
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:56,300
Fredo!

512
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:44,908
Papa.

513
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:48,210
Papa!

514
00:45:53,945 --> 00:45:54,808
Would you like me better if I were a nun...

515
00:45:56,511 --> 00:45:58,444
like in the story, you know?

516
00:46:02,212 --> 00:46:05,143
Then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

517
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:07,402
Now that's a thought.

518
00:46:11,145 --> 00:46:13,668
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

519
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:16,068
- Mike...
- What's the matter?

520
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:34,773
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

521
00:46:57,178 --> 00:47:00,406
- Sonny, Michael.
- Michael, where you been?

522
00:47:00,512 --> 00:47:02,102
Is he all right?

523
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,870
We don't know yet. There's all kinds of stories.

524
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:08,640
He wash it bad, Mikey.

525
00:47:09,345 --> 00:47:11,743
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

526
00:47:12,678 --> 00:47:14,542
Where you been? I was worried.

527
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:17,171
Didn't Tom tell you? I called.

528
00:47:17,344 --> 00:47:21,277
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

529
00:47:21,512 --> 00:47:22,909
All right.

530
00:47:29,412 --> 00:47:31,038
Oh, my God.

531
00:47:47,746 --> 00:47:48,439
Go. Who is it?

532
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:50,635
Open up. It's Clemenza.

533
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:52,606
What?

534
00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:54,767
There's more news about your old man.

535
00:47:55,946 --> 00:47:57,707
The word is out on the street he's already dead.

536
00:47:57,912 --> 00:47:59,707
Shut your mouth. What's the matter with you?

537
00:48:00,145 --> 00:48:02,112
Jesus Christ! Take it easy.

538
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:04,510
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

539
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:07,111
- He's been sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

540
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:08,504
Only maybe three, four times.

541
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:10,372
I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

542
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:11,909
- He said no.
- Pick him up now.

543
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,340
I don't care how sick he is.

544
00:48:13,512 --> 00:48:16,205
If he's breathing', I want you to
bring him to my father's house now.

545
00:48:17,445 --> 00:48:20,172
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

546
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:21,174
All right.

547
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:30,972
I'm havin' a couple of our people come to the house.

548
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:38,536
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

549
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:41,143
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

550
00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:44,906
In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.

551
00:48:45,412 --> 00:48:48,311
Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.

552
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:50,674
What's done is done.

553
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,074
And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?

554
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:55,309
No, I'll wait.

555
00:49:09,645 --> 00:49:11,440
Your boss is dead.

556
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,402
I know you're not in
the muscle end of the family...

557
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:19,304
so I don't want you to be scared.

558
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:22,104
I want you to help the Corleones...

559
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:24,577
and I want you to help me.

560
00:49:27,846 --> 00:49:29,244
We got him outside his office...

561
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:31,878
about an hour after we picked you up.

562
00:49:32,145 --> 00:49:33,805
Drink it.

563
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:43,506
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

564
00:49:47,412 --> 00:49:49,901
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

565
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,877
And you knew it was the right thing to do.

566
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,338
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

567
00:49:59,013 --> 00:50:01,775
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

568
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:04,474
That's why you gotta talk some sense into him.

569
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:08,611
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

570
00:50:08,846 --> 00:50:10,869
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

571
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:13,305
that will prevent a full-scale war.

572
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:16,411
Let's face it, in all due respect...

573
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:19,543
the don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

574
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:24,508
Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?

575
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:30,443
Well, now he's dead.

576
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:33,204
He's dead, and nothing can bring him back.

577
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:36,903
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

578
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,238
You gotta talk to the caporegimes...

579
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:41,610
that Tessio, that fat Clemenza.

580
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:47,975
It's good business, Tom.

581
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,112
I'll try.

582
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,338
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

583
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:59,037
Yeah. Well...

584
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:02,739
Let me worry about Luca.

585
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:09,975
You just talk to Sonny.

586
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:12,575
And the other two kids.

587
00:51:15,746 --> 00:51:17,610
I'll do my best.

588
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,268
Good.

589
00:51:20,712 --> 00:51:23,304
Now, you can go.

590
00:51:30,214 --> 00:51:33,646
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

591
00:51:34,947 --> 00:51:37,105
Blood is a big expense.

592
00:51:58,613 --> 00:52:00,170
He's still alive.

593
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,139
They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!

594
00:52:04,446 --> 00:52:06,174
Well, that's bad luck for me...

595
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:09,039
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

596
00:52:53,946 --> 00:52:55,913
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

597
00:52:56,147 --> 00:52:58,306
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

598
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:02,775
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

599
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,606
It's too far. I think it's too personal.

600
00:53:06,446 --> 00:53:08,606
- The don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

601
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:11,041
- Stay out of it, Mickey.
- Sollozzo's the key.

602
00:53:11,214 --> 00:53:13,237
You get rid of him, everything falls into line.

603
00:53:13,414 --> 00:53:16,175
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

604
00:53:17,813 --> 00:53:19,779
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

605
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,574
Has anyone been able to get in touch with Luca?

606
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:25,476
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

607
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:26,907
Mick, try him again.

608
00:53:27,147 --> 00:53:27,908
Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

609
00:53:28,147 --> 00:53:29,669
He always goes home when he's through.

610
00:53:29,947 --> 00:53:34,403
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

611
00:53:34,947 --> 00:53:37,413
What do we do if the old man dies, God forbid?

612
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,672
If we lose the old man...

613
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:44,103
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

614
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,041
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

615
00:53:47,214 --> 00:53:49,772
just to avoid a long destructive war.

616
00:53:49,947 --> 00:53:53,641
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

617
00:53:54,381 --> 00:53:56,278
If your father dies...

618
00:53:58,581 --> 00:54:00,308
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

619
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:02,978
That's easy for you to say. He's not your father.

620
00:54:03,247 --> 00:54:05,611
I was as much a son to him as you or Mike.

621
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:11,604
What is it?

622
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,609
Hey, Paulie, I thought I told you to stay put.

623
00:54:14,848 --> 00:54:17,404
The guy at the gates, they say they got a package.

624
00:54:17,613 --> 00:54:19,773
Yeah? Tessio, go see what it is.

625
00:54:23,646 --> 00:54:25,203
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

626
00:54:25,414 --> 00:54:26,811
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

627
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,776
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry?

628
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:31,470
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a little brandy?

629
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:33,504
- That's good to sweat it out.
- Sure.

630
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:35,373
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

631
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:40,208
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

632
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:41,607
Paulie sold out the old man.

633
00:54:41,814 --> 00:54:45,439
I don't wanna see him again.
Make that first thing on your list.

634
00:54:45,614 --> 00:54:46,409
Understood.

635
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,674
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow
you get a couple of guys.

636
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:52,110
Go to Luca's apartment.
Wait for him to show up.

637
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:55,178
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

638
00:54:56,314 --> 00:54:58,109
Yeah.

639
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,405
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

640
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,312
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

641
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:16,573
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

642
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:19,871
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

643
00:55:33,148 --> 00:55:35,204
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home?

644
00:55:35,447 --> 00:55:37,675
I don't know. Probably late.

645
00:55:39,646 --> 00:55:42,636
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah.

646
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:49,842
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

647
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,207
Sonny's runnin' wild.

648
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:55,074
He's thinkin' of goin' to the mattresses already.

649
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:57,770
We gotta find a spot over on the West Side.

650
00:55:57,948 --> 00:56:00,879
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

651
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,308
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

652
00:56:03,481 --> 00:56:05,709
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Think while you're drivin'.

653
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:08,344
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

654
00:56:08,547 --> 00:56:10,842
And watch out for the kids when you're backin' out.

655
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,578
Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

656
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:26,941
Pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep. Bring me the bill.

657
00:56:27,114 --> 00:56:29,945
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean.

658
00:56:30,148 --> 00:56:32,613
Those guys are gonna be stuck up
in there for a long time.

659
00:56:32,781 --> 00:56:35,077
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

660
00:56:35,248 --> 00:56:37,270
Exterminate? That's a bad word to use.

661
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:40,505
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

662
00:56:40,714 --> 00:56:42,304
- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie?

663
00:56:42,814 --> 00:56:46,906
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. It wasn't me.

664
00:56:47,114 --> 00:56:49,013
- It's gotta be him.
- Pull over.

665
00:56:49,148 --> 00:56:50,738
I gotta take a leak.

666
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:34,013
Leave the gun.

667
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:36,076
Take the cannoli.

668
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:01,109
- Yeah?
- You're wanted on the telephone.

669
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:09,211
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

670
00:58:13,348 --> 00:58:14,370
Hello, Kay?

671
00:58:14,547 --> 00:58:15,706
How's your father?

672
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:18,279
He's good. He's gonna make it.

673
00:58:18,448 --> 00:58:19,936
I love you.

674
00:58:20,348 --> 00:58:23,007
I love you!

675
00:58:24,148 --> 00:58:26,546
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

676
00:58:26,748 --> 00:58:28,305
Tell me you love me.

677
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:30,977
- I can't talk.
- Can't you say it?

678
00:58:32,715 --> 00:58:34,613
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

679
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:38,514
Why don't you tell that nice girl you love her?

680
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,373
I love you with all o' my heart!

681
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:43,173
If I don't see you again a-soon, I'm-a gonna die!

682
00:58:44,482 --> 00:58:46,277
Come over here, kid. Learn somethin'.

683
00:58:46,448 --> 00:58:49,073
You might have to cook for 20 guys someday.

684
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:51,573
You see? You start out with a little bit of oil.

685
00:58:51,748 --> 00:58:53,339
Then you fry some garlic.

686
00:58:53,548 --> 00:58:56,013
Then you throw in some
tomatoes, some tomato paste.

687
00:58:56,181 --> 00:58:58,443
You fry it. You make sure it doesn't stick.

688
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:02,043
When you got it to a boil, shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

689
00:59:05,016 --> 00:59:06,878
And a little bit of wine.

690
00:59:10,149 --> 00:59:13,114
And a little bit of sugar.

691
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:15,915
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

692
00:59:16,115 --> 00:59:17,978
I got more important things for you to do.

693
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:20,511
- How's Paulie?
- Won't see him no more.

694
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:25,011
- Where you going?
- To the city.

695
00:59:25,348 --> 00:59:26,371
Send some bodyguards with him.

696
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:28,878
- I'm just going to see Pop.
- Send somebody with him.

697
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:31,275
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

698
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:34,471
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

699
00:59:37,582 --> 00:59:39,514
Send somebody with him anyway.

700
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:09,880
I have to go.

701
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,671
Can I go with you?

702
01:00:13,015 --> 01:00:15,005
No, Kay. There's gonna be detectives there.

703
01:00:15,515 --> 01:00:17,345
People from the press.

704
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:19,307
I'll ride in a cab.

705
01:00:22,016 --> 01:00:23,844
I don't want you to get involved.

706
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:29,610
When will I see you again?

707
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:37,815
Go back to New Hampshire...

708
01:00:38,149 --> 01:00:40,706
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

709
01:00:41,749 --> 01:00:43,908
When will I see you again, Michael?

710
01:00:45,715 --> 01:00:47,806
I don't know.

711
01:02:59,082 --> 01:03:00,309
What are you doing here?

712
01:03:00,516 --> 01:03:02,448
You're not supposed to be here now.

713
01:03:02,683 --> 01:03:05,274
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

714
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,714
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

715
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:11,073
Your father just had too many visitors.

716
01:03:11,282 --> 01:03:13,578
They interfered with hospital service.

717
01:03:14,149 --> 01:03:16,775
The police made them leave about ten minutes ago.

718
01:03:21,983 --> 01:03:26,312
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

719
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:31,106
Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.

720
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:37,042
Sonny, Michael. I'm at the hospital.

721
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:39,410
Listen. I got here late. There's nobody here.

722
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:42,908
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

723
01:03:43,117 --> 01:03:45,639
- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.

724
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:47,247
I won't panic.

725
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,839
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

726
01:03:53,783 --> 01:03:56,681
You and I are gonna move
my father to another room.

727
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:57,747
Can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

728
01:03:59,783 --> 01:04:02,340
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

729
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:05,182
Men are coming here to kill him.

730
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,506
You understand?

731
01:04:07,716 --> 01:04:09,477
Now, help me, please.

732
01:05:26,816 --> 01:05:30,010
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

733
01:05:31,317 --> 01:05:32,783
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

734
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,472
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

735
01:05:34,649 --> 01:05:36,638
There's gonna be trouble.

736
01:05:36,816 --> 01:05:39,044
If there is trouble, I stay here to help you...

737
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:40,079
For your father.

738
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,713
All right, listen.

739
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,711
Wait for me outside, in front of the hospital.

740
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:49,405
All right? I'll be out in a minute. Go ahead.

741
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:07,482
Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now.

742
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:11,311
I'm with you now.

743
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:14,649
I'm with you.

744
01:06:49,951 --> 01:06:51,813
Get rid of these. Come here.

745
01:06:53,117 --> 01:06:55,310
Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun.

746
01:06:55,851 --> 01:06:57,544
You'll be all right.

747
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:04,907
You'll be okay.

748
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,148
You did good.

749
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:26,240
Here he is.

750
01:08:26,951 --> 01:08:28,611
All right, hold still.

751
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:41,108
I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up.

752
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,215
What are you doing here?

753
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:44,940
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

754
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:46,815
Why, you little punk.

755
01:08:46,984 --> 01:08:48,916
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

756
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:50,777
I pulled them guys off of here.

757
01:08:50,951 --> 01:08:53,315
You get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

758
01:08:53,984 --> 01:08:56,779
I'm not moving until you put some
guards around my father's room.

759
01:08:57,584 --> 01:08:59,312
Phil, take him in.

760
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:01,949
The kid's clean, Captain. He's a war hero.

761
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:04,912
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

762
01:09:07,084 --> 01:09:10,278
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

763
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:13,443
Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

764
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:15,880
Stand him up straight.

765
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:39,350
I'm the attorney for the Corleone family.

766
01:09:39,585 --> 01:09:42,050
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

767
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:45,412
They're licensed to carry firearms.

768
01:09:45,585 --> 01:09:47,243
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

769
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:49,883
in the morning and show cause.

770
01:09:50,218 --> 01:09:51,844
All right, let him go.

771
01:09:53,617 --> 01:09:55,106
Come on.

772
01:10:24,751 --> 01:10:26,513
What's with all the new faces?

773
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,445
Gonna need 'em now.

774
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:30,808
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

775
01:10:31,618 --> 01:10:34,515
We hit Bruno Tattaglia at 4:00 this morning.

776
01:10:35,718 --> 01:10:37,445
Jesus Christ.

777
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:46,684
Looks like a fortress around here.

778
01:10:51,718 --> 01:10:54,309
A hundred button men on the street, 24 hours a day.

779
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,310
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

780
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,715
Hey, Michael, come here.
Let me look at you.

781
01:11:06,351 --> 01:11:08,079
You look beautiful. Just beautiful.

782
01:11:08,251 --> 01:11:09,512
You're gorgeous.

783
01:11:09,685 --> 01:11:12,480
Hey, listen to this. The Turk, he wants to talk.

784
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:14,817
Imagine the nerve on this son of a bitch.

785
01:11:15,251 --> 01:11:17,342
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

786
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:19,108
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

787
01:11:20,717 --> 01:11:22,809
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

788
01:11:23,019 --> 01:11:25,916
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

789
01:11:26,485 --> 01:11:28,110
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

790
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,807
That's part of the deal.

791
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,847
Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.

792
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:33,575
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

793
01:11:33,785 --> 01:11:37,217
No more. Not this time, Consigliere.

794
01:11:37,385 --> 01:11:40,783
No more meetings, no discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

795
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:42,815
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

796
01:11:43,019 --> 01:11:44,280
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

797
01:11:44,451 --> 01:11:45,974
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

798
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:48,116
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't like this.

799
01:11:48,318 --> 01:11:50,285
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

800
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:53,951
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

801
01:11:54,918 --> 01:11:56,179
Well, then business will have to suffer.

802
01:11:56,385 --> 01:11:58,317
And do me a favor, Tom...

803
01:11:58,685 --> 01:12:00,379
No more advice on how to patch things up.

804
01:12:00,518 --> 01:12:02,848
Just help me win, please. All right?

805
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:11,711
I found out about this McCluskey
who broke Mike'sjaw.

806
01:12:11,884 --> 01:12:13,214
What about him?

807
01:12:13,385 --> 01:12:16,409
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

808
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:19,240
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

809
01:12:19,451 --> 01:12:21,350
What you have to understand, Sonny...

810
01:12:21,552 --> 01:12:23,414
is that while Sollozzo's being guarded like this...

811
01:12:23,651 --> 01:12:25,311
he is invulnerable.

812
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:29,015
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

813
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:31,707
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you.

814
01:12:31,952 --> 01:12:34,747
The Corleone family would be outcast.

815
01:12:35,052 --> 01:12:38,415
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

816
01:12:40,185 --> 01:12:42,208
So do me a favor.

817
01:12:42,519 --> 01:12:45,349
Take this into consideration.

818
01:12:48,019 --> 01:12:49,780
All right, we'll wait.

819
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:56,716
We can't wait.

820
01:12:57,319 --> 01:12:59,284
Can't wait.

821
01:12:59,685 --> 01:13:01,117
I don't care what Sollozzo says about a deal.

822
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:03,217
He's gonna kill Pop. That's it.

823
01:13:03,452 --> 01:13:05,008
That's the key for him.

824
01:13:05,351 --> 01:13:07,284
Got to get Sollozzo.

825
01:13:07,452 --> 01:13:08,940
Mike is right.

826
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,247
Let me ask you something first.

827
01:13:11,752 --> 01:13:13,412
What about this McCluskey?

828
01:13:14,651 --> 01:13:16,379
What do we do with this cop?

829
01:13:21,518 --> 01:13:23,951
They want to have a meeting with me, right?

830
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:26,977
It will be me...

831
01:13:28,152 --> 01:13:30,413
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

832
01:13:31,685 --> 01:13:33,981
Let's set the meeting.

833
01:13:35,918 --> 01:13:39,146
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

834
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:45,242
We insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

835
01:13:45,451 --> 01:13:49,578
Someplace where there's people, so I feel safe.

836
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:54,683
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

837
01:13:54,886 --> 01:13:57,283
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

838
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:03,140
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

839
01:14:03,352 --> 01:14:05,443
to have a weapon planted there for me...

840
01:14:10,486 --> 01:14:12,781
then I'll kill them both.

841
01:14:24,786 --> 01:14:27,615
What are you gonna do? Nice college boy, huh?

842
01:14:27,785 --> 01:14:29,581
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

843
01:14:29,786 --> 01:14:30,877
Now you want to gun down a police captain?

844
01:14:31,086 --> 01:14:33,347
Why? 'Cause he slapped you in the face a little bit?

845
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,643
Do you think this is the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

846
01:14:35,853 --> 01:14:37,341
You gotta get up close, like this and...

847
01:14:37,551 --> 01:14:40,814
You blow their brains all over your
nice lvy League suit. Come here.

848
01:14:41,486 --> 01:14:43,247
You're taking this very personal.

849
01:14:43,419 --> 01:14:46,749
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

850
01:14:46,953 --> 01:14:49,043
Where does it say you can't kill a cop?

851
01:14:49,419 --> 01:14:51,079
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

852
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:54,184
I'm talking about a cop that's mixed up in drugs.

853
01:14:54,352 --> 01:14:58,079
I'm talking about a dishonest cop, a crooked cop...

854
01:14:58,252 --> 01:15:01,185
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

855
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:03,480
That's a terrific story.

856
01:15:03,686 --> 01:15:06,311
We have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

857
01:15:07,652 --> 01:15:09,914
They might like a story like that.

858
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:12,177
They might. They just might.

859
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:16,478
It's not personal, Sonny.

860
01:15:17,586 --> 01:15:19,449
It's strictly business.

861
01:15:21,986 --> 01:15:23,576
It's as cold as they come.

862
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,719
Impossible to trace, so you
don't worry about prints, Mike.

863
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,978
I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt.

864
01:15:30,352 --> 01:15:31,943
Here. Try it.

865
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:45,777
What's the matter, the trigger too tight?

866
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:51,414
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

867
01:15:51,586 --> 01:15:54,915
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

868
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:58,182
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

869
01:16:01,085 --> 01:16:02,847
Sit down, finish my dinner.

870
01:16:03,487 --> 01:16:05,111
Come on, kid. Don't fool around.

871
01:16:05,285 --> 01:16:08,275
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

872
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,582
Everybody will still think you got it.

873
01:16:10,986 --> 01:16:12,508
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

874
01:16:13,153 --> 01:16:15,846
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

875
01:16:16,252 --> 01:16:18,946
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but don't look away, either.

876
01:16:20,086 --> 01:16:21,813
They're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

877
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,713
so don't worry about nothing.

878
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:27,079
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

879
01:16:27,252 --> 01:16:29,378
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

880
01:16:29,653 --> 01:16:31,584
and we're gonna catch the hell.

881
01:16:32,352 --> 01:16:34,285
How bad do you think it's gonna be?

882
01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:36,179
Pretty goddamn bad.

883
01:16:36,352 --> 01:16:38,648
Probably all the other families will line up against us.

884
01:16:39,453 --> 01:16:42,384
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

885
01:16:42,586 --> 01:16:45,052
Ten years. Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

886
01:16:45,253 --> 01:16:47,218
Been ten years since the last one.

887
01:16:47,953 --> 01:16:49,714
You gotta stop them
at the beginning...

888
01:16:49,953 --> 01:16:51,919
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

889
01:16:52,185 --> 01:16:53,651
They should have never let him
get away with that.

890
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:56,215
They was just asking for big trouble.

891
01:16:56,753 --> 01:16:59,481
You know, Mike, we was all proud of you...

892
01:16:59,686 --> 01:17:01,243
being a hero and all.

893
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,283
Your father too.

894
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:42,811
Nothing. Not a hint.

895
01:17:42,986 --> 01:17:44,611
Absolutely nothing.

896
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,312
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

897
01:17:49,853 --> 01:17:51,911
How much time do we have?

898
01:17:53,087 --> 01:17:54,608
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

899
01:17:54,786 --> 01:17:55,979
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

900
01:17:59,253 --> 01:18:01,719
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

901
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:04,748
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

902
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,018
What about the negotiator?

903
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,845
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

904
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,043
He's happy. They're letting him win.

905
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,379
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off.

906
01:18:14,586 --> 01:18:18,519
The negotiator keeps playing cards
until Mike's back safe and sound.

907
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,947
Why doesn't he blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

908
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,518
Too dangerous. They'll be looking for that.

909
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,618
Sollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny.

910
01:18:25,953 --> 01:18:27,920
I got it.

911
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:39,679
Yeah.

912
01:18:52,787 --> 01:18:56,275
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Is it reliable?

913
01:18:56,487 --> 01:18:58,453
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

914
01:18:58,653 --> 01:19:00,914
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

915
01:19:01,086 --> 01:19:03,814
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

916
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:05,346
Anybody know this joint?

917
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:09,111
Yeah, sure. I do. It's perfect for us.

918
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:11,319
A small family place, good food.

919
01:19:11,587 --> 01:19:14,213
Everyone minds his business. It's perfect.

920
01:19:14,387 --> 01:19:17,012
Pete, they got an old-fashioned toilet...

921
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,311
You know, the box and the chain thing.

922
01:19:22,086 --> 01:19:25,076
We might be able to tape the gun behind it.

923
01:19:25,254 --> 01:19:26,277
All right.

924
01:19:26,453 --> 01:19:29,351
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

925
01:19:29,553 --> 01:19:31,417
You eat, you talk for a while, you relax.

926
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:33,410
You make them relax.

927
01:19:33,653 --> 01:19:35,448
Then you get up and go take a leak.

928
01:19:35,954 --> 01:19:38,818
No, better still, you ask for permission to go.

929
01:19:39,054 --> 01:19:40,781
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

930
01:19:41,021 --> 01:19:43,418
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

931
01:19:43,854 --> 01:19:45,820
Now, listen. I want somebody good...

932
01:19:46,054 --> 01:19:47,815
and I mean very good... to plant that gun.

933
01:19:47,986 --> 01:19:50,283
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick in his hands.

934
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,479
The gun will be there.

935
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:56,209
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

936
01:19:57,054 --> 01:19:58,917
Come on. Let's move.

937
01:19:59,787 --> 01:20:01,776
Thank you, Tom.

938
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,310
Did he tell you to drop the gun right away?

939
01:20:07,488 --> 01:20:09,453
Yeah, a million times.

940
01:20:14,153 --> 01:20:16,416
Don't forget... two shots apiece in the head...

941
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,712
as soon as you come out the door.

942
01:20:17,887 --> 01:20:19,580
Let's go.

943
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,647
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

944
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:31,477
At least a year, Mike.

945
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,050
Listen, I'll square with Mom you
not seeing her before you leave...

946
01:20:37,721 --> 01:20:39,811
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

947
01:20:40,286 --> 01:20:42,912
when I think the time is right.

948
01:20:47,688 --> 01:20:49,710
Take care.

949
01:20:52,154 --> 01:20:54,346
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

950
01:21:26,387 --> 01:21:28,411
I'm glad you came, Mike.

951
01:21:28,721 --> 01:21:31,016
I hope we can straighten everything out.

952
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:34,916
This is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

953
01:21:35,154 --> 01:21:36,585
It should have never happened.

954
01:21:36,754 --> 01:21:38,516
I want to straighten everything out tonight.

955
01:21:38,688 --> 01:21:40,880
I don't want my father bothered anymore.

956
01:21:41,087 --> 01:21:44,110
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

957
01:21:45,354 --> 01:21:47,785
But you got to keep an open mind when we talk.

958
01:21:48,721 --> 01:21:50,687
I hope you're not a hothead
like your brother Sonny.

959
01:21:50,921 --> 01:21:53,045
You can't talk business with him.

960
01:21:54,921 --> 01:21:57,011
He's a good kid.

961
01:22:00,688 --> 01:22:03,347
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

962
01:22:04,254 --> 01:22:06,686
I gotta frisk you, so turn around, huh?

963
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:08,616
On your knees, facing me.

964
01:22:13,488 --> 01:22:16,011
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.

965
01:22:16,821 --> 01:22:18,684
Too grouchy.

966
01:22:19,287 --> 01:22:21,583
Can't stand the aggravation.

967
01:22:21,955 --> 01:22:23,920
You know how it is.

968
01:22:25,521 --> 01:22:27,816
He's clean.

969
01:22:53,687 --> 01:22:55,244
We're going to Jersey?

970
01:22:58,422 --> 01:23:00,114
Maybe.

971
01:23:25,254 --> 01:23:26,720
Nice work, Lou.

972
01:24:04,255 --> 01:24:06,220
How's the Italian food in this restaurant?

973
01:24:06,488 --> 01:24:08,386
Good. Try the veal.

974
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:11,052
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

975
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:48,853
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

976
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:51,318
Go ahead.

977
01:26:10,022 --> 01:26:11,648
What I want...

978
01:26:12,455 --> 01:26:14,614
what's most important to me...

979
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:19,354
is that I have a guarantee:

980
01:26:19,589 --> 01:26:21,521
No more attempts on my father's life.

981
01:26:21,755 --> 01:26:25,653
What guarantees could I give you?
I am the hunted one.

982
01:26:26,555 --> 01:26:29,578
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

983
01:26:30,023 --> 01:26:31,682
I'm not that clever.

984
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,912
All I want is a truce.

985
01:26:42,255 --> 01:26:46,347
I have to go to the bathroom. Is that all right?

986
01:26:47,455 --> 01:26:49,614
You gotta go, you gotta go.

987
01:26:55,622 --> 01:26:57,520
I frisked him. He's clean.

988
01:26:57,756 --> 01:26:59,483
Don't take too long.

989
01:27:02,988 --> 01:27:05,148
I've frisked a thousand young punks.

990
01:30:55,757 --> 01:30:56,586
Hey, come on.

991
01:30:56,957 --> 01:30:58,445
Come on. Let's go.

992
01:31:55,391 --> 01:31:57,288
Joe, you take over.

993
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,253
Hi, Grandpa.

994
01:32:14,823 --> 01:32:16,221
I love you, Grandpa.

995
01:32:19,456 --> 01:32:21,480
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

996
01:32:23,356 --> 01:32:25,414
Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.

997
01:32:25,657 --> 01:32:28,383
I hope you get well, Grandpa...

998
01:32:28,556 --> 01:32:30,614
and I wish I would see you soon.

999
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:32,813
Love, your grandson, Frank.

1000
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:37,554
Go with your mother.

1001
01:32:38,189 --> 01:32:40,179
Go ahead. Take 'em downstairs.

1002
01:32:46,657 --> 01:32:48,815
Go on, Carlo. You too.

1003
01:32:50,124 --> 01:32:52,215
Go on.

1004
01:32:55,857 --> 01:32:57,983
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

1005
01:32:58,556 --> 01:33:00,715
- That's enough bread.
- I love bread.

1006
01:33:01,024 --> 01:33:01,388
But how much can you eat?

1007
01:33:12,424 --> 01:33:14,253
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

1008
01:33:14,456 --> 01:33:16,355
Shut up and set the table.

1009
01:33:32,057 --> 01:33:34,387
Since McCluskey's killing...

1010
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:38,316
the police have been cracking down
on most of our operations.

1011
01:33:39,758 --> 01:33:41,916
And also the other families'.

1012
01:33:43,057 --> 01:33:44,819
Been a lot of bad blood.

1013
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:47,979
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1014
01:33:49,058 --> 01:33:51,114
Through our contacts in the newspapers...

1015
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:53,381
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

1016
01:33:53,691 --> 01:33:57,214
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1017
01:33:57,990 --> 01:34:00,389
See, things are starting to loosen up.

1018
01:34:03,457 --> 01:34:06,150
Dad, I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas...

1019
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:08,914
under the protection of don Francesco of L.A.

1020
01:34:09,124 --> 01:34:10,715
I want him to rest.

1021
01:34:10,957 --> 01:34:13,150
I'm going to learn the casino business.

1022
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:14,789
Yeah.

1023
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:24,483
Where is Michael?

1024
01:34:35,791 --> 01:34:39,279
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1025
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:44,815
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

1026
01:35:06,457 --> 01:35:08,389
I want you to find out where that
little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

1027
01:35:08,557 --> 01:35:10,250
I want his ass now... right now.

1028
01:35:10,524 --> 01:35:12,150
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

1029
01:35:12,358 --> 01:35:13,947
Things are starting to loosen up a little bit.

1030
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:16,816
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

1031
01:35:17,025 --> 01:35:18,684
Let the smoke clear. Pop can negotiate.

1032
01:35:18,858 --> 01:35:20,915
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide...

1033
01:35:21,158 --> 01:35:23,385
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

1034
01:35:23,557 --> 01:35:24,989
Nothing's coming in. We can't do business.

1035
01:35:25,157 --> 01:35:26,351
Neither can they. Don't worry about it.

1036
01:35:26,524 --> 01:35:29,922
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Then there ain't no more stalemate.

1037
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,920
I'm gonna end it by killing that old bastard.

1038
01:35:32,258 --> 01:35:34,519
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

1039
01:35:34,624 --> 01:35:35,920
Do what I tell you to do!

1040
01:35:36,091 --> 01:35:38,148
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere... a Sicilian...

1041
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:40,152
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1042
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:42,721
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1043
01:35:46,058 --> 01:35:48,081
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1044
01:35:49,591 --> 01:35:51,887
Mom made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

1045
01:35:53,592 --> 01:35:54,579
Niggers are having a good time...

1046
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,916
with our policy banks up there in Harlem.

1047
01:35:58,125 --> 01:36:01,023
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1048
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:04,750
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1049
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:08,280
Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1050
01:36:09,058 --> 01:36:11,853
- Shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1051
01:36:12,025 --> 01:36:14,991
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1052
01:36:17,025 --> 01:36:19,651
Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1053
01:36:19,892 --> 01:36:21,050
I could be doing more for the family.

1054
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:23,655
We don't discuss business at the table.

1055
01:37:51,158 --> 01:37:52,954
Corleone.

1056
01:39:02,358 --> 01:39:04,551
Hey, American! Take me to America! G.I.!

1057
01:39:06,625 --> 01:39:09,421
Take me to America, G.I. Clark Gable.

1058
01:42:10,726 --> 01:42:12,555
I apologize if I offended you.

1059
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:15,084
I'm a stranger in this country...

1060
01:42:15,993 --> 01:42:18,925
and I meant no disrespect to you or your daughter.

1061
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:27,091
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1062
01:42:29,026 --> 01:42:31,391
My name is Michael Corleone.

1063
01:42:33,526 --> 01:42:36,424
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1064
01:42:39,559 --> 01:42:42,025
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1065
01:42:44,393 --> 01:42:46,518
instead of gaining a husband.

1066
01:42:54,693 --> 01:42:55,659
I want to meet your daughter...

1067
01:42:57,659 --> 01:42:59,420
with your permission...

1068
01:42:59,659 --> 01:43:01,818
and under the supervision of your family...

1069
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:05,257
with all respect.

1070
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,987
Apollonia.

1071
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,854
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1072
01:46:24,894 --> 01:46:26,689
Save it for the library.

1073
01:46:30,627 --> 01:46:32,024
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1074
01:46:51,161 --> 01:46:52,683
What's the matter?

1075
01:46:59,061 --> 01:47:00,527
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1076
01:47:00,694 --> 01:47:03,922
Sonny, please. It was my fault. I hit him.

1077
01:47:04,194 --> 01:47:05,853
I started a fight with him. Please, Sonny.

1078
01:47:06,028 --> 01:47:07,789
I'm sorry.

1079
01:47:13,227 --> 01:47:16,353
I'm just gonna get a doctor
to come and take a look at you.

1080
01:47:16,528 --> 01:47:18,390
Sonny, please don't do anything.

1081
01:47:20,861 --> 01:47:22,918
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1082
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:25,354
Am I gonna make that baby an
orphan before he's born?

1083
01:47:29,261 --> 01:47:30,590
All right?

1084
01:47:30,894 --> 01:47:33,223
Still betting the Yankees pretty heavy?

1085
01:47:34,128 --> 01:47:36,094
Tell him to stop taking action, all right?

1086
01:47:37,361 --> 01:47:39,588
You lost enough money last weekend to me.

1087
01:47:46,061 --> 01:47:47,550
Carlo, come here.

1088
01:48:45,228 --> 01:48:48,160
You touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

1089
01:52:43,162 --> 01:52:45,754
Weren't expecting you. You should call.

1090
01:52:45,962 --> 01:52:50,361
Yes, well, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

1091
01:52:50,529 --> 01:52:52,688
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1092
01:52:52,896 --> 01:52:56,589
Nobody knows where he is. We
know he's all right, but that's all.

1093
01:52:59,562 --> 01:53:01,585
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1094
01:53:01,829 --> 01:53:03,589
But nobody was hurt.

1095
01:53:05,796 --> 01:53:09,421
Would you give this letter to Michael, please?

1096
01:53:09,928 --> 01:53:11,895
Well, if I accepted that...

1097
01:53:12,095 --> 01:53:15,152
in a court of law they could prove I have
knowledge of his whereabouts.

1098
01:53:15,662 --> 01:53:17,992
Just be patient. He'll get in touch with you.

1099
01:53:18,163 --> 01:53:21,287
I let my cab go. Can I come in to call another one?

1100
01:53:21,796 --> 01:53:23,921
Come on. I'm sorry. Come on.

1101
01:53:41,062 --> 01:53:42,528
Hello?

1102
01:53:44,696 --> 01:53:46,252
Is Carlo there?

1103
01:53:46,396 --> 01:53:48,726
- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo's.

1104
01:53:48,829 --> 01:53:52,352
Would you tell him that
can't make it tonight until later?

1105
01:53:57,229 --> 01:53:59,162
Bitch.

1106
01:54:01,362 --> 01:54:03,828
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1107
01:54:04,163 --> 01:54:05,595
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1108
01:54:05,828 --> 01:54:08,795
- I'll eat out later.
- You told me to make you dinner.

1109
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:11,024
Hey, vafifiancolo, eh?

1110
01:54:11,195 --> 01:54:13,286
I'll vafifianculo you!

1111
01:54:19,462 --> 01:54:21,792
This little guinea brat.

1112
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:27,918
That's it. Break it all, you spoiled guinea brat.

1113
01:54:28,095 --> 01:54:29,584
Break it all!

1114
01:54:29,763 --> 01:54:31,853
That's it. Break it all.

1115
01:54:39,362 --> 01:54:41,625
Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner?

1116
01:54:43,596 --> 01:54:45,528
Maybe I will. Why not?

1117
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:54,593
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1118
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:59,723
Clean it up, you guinea spoiled brat!

1119
01:55:00,529 --> 01:55:02,893
Clean it up! Clean it up!

1120
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:05,189
You son of a bitch!

1121
01:55:15,163 --> 01:55:17,924
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1122
01:55:18,129 --> 01:55:20,028
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1123
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:21,594
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1124
01:55:21,763 --> 01:55:23,695
Kill me! Get up!

1125
01:55:24,262 --> 01:55:25,819
Get out of here!

1126
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:28,757
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

1127
01:55:29,596 --> 01:55:31,324
You guinea brat, you.

1128
01:55:31,497 --> 01:55:32,724
Get out here!

1129
01:55:43,163 --> 01:55:46,288
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1130
01:55:47,063 --> 01:55:49,893
Talk louder. The baby's crying.

1131
01:55:50,063 --> 01:55:51,722
Santino, I can't understand... I don't know.

1132
01:55:51,963 --> 01:55:53,020
I don't understand.

1133
01:55:53,230 --> 01:55:55,219
Yeah, Connie.

1134
01:56:01,096 --> 01:56:02,722
Listen, you wait there.

1135
01:56:05,362 --> 01:56:07,727
No, you just wait there.

1136
01:56:10,396 --> 01:56:12,556
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1137
01:56:12,763 --> 01:56:14,753
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1138
01:56:14,964 --> 01:56:16,361
Damn it!

1139
01:56:19,563 --> 01:56:21,994
Open the goddamn gate. Get off your ass.

1140
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:40,419
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1141
01:56:41,529 --> 01:56:43,393
Go after him. Go on.

1142
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:14,553
Son of a bitch.

1143
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:16,355
Come on! Come on!

1144
01:59:03,897 --> 01:59:05,454
Give me a drop.

1145
01:59:14,097 --> 01:59:16,392
My wife is crying upstairs.

1146
01:59:19,464 --> 01:59:21,952
I hear cars coming to the house.

1147
01:59:25,831 --> 01:59:28,728
Consigliore of mine...

1148
01:59:29,164 --> 01:59:32,721
I think you should tell your don
what everyone seems to know.

1149
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:35,192
I didn't tell Mama anything.

1150
01:59:35,964 --> 01:59:39,260
I was about to come up and wake
you just now and tell you.

1151
01:59:42,663 --> 01:59:44,891
But you needed a drink first.

1152
01:59:51,631 --> 01:59:54,653
Now you've had your drink.

1153
01:59:59,697 --> 02:00:03,891
They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead.

1154
02:00:21,297 --> 02:00:23,888
I want all inquiries made.

1155
02:00:27,931 --> 02:00:30,396
I want no acts of vengeance.

1156
02:00:32,064 --> 02:00:34,257
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1157
02:00:35,797 --> 02:00:38,162
with the heads of the five families.

1158
02:00:40,464 --> 02:00:42,692
This war stops now.

1159
02:01:04,531 --> 02:01:06,394
Call Bonasera.

1160
02:01:07,031 --> 02:01:09,123
We need him now.

1161
02:01:21,798 --> 02:01:24,423
This is Tom Hagen calling for Vito Corleone...

1162
02:01:24,598 --> 02:01:25,995
at his request.

1163
02:01:26,765 --> 02:01:28,697
Now, you owe your don a service.

1164
02:01:29,265 --> 02:01:32,526
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

1165
02:01:33,831 --> 02:01:35,728
Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.

1166
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:37,658
Be there to greet him.

1167
02:01:58,531 --> 02:01:59,827
Well, my friend...

1168
02:02:00,831 --> 02:02:03,160
are you ready to do me this service?

1169
02:02:03,331 --> 02:02:04,558
Yes.

1170
02:02:05,531 --> 02:02:07,497
What do you want me to do?

1171
02:02:14,865 --> 02:02:17,387
I want you to use all your powers...

1172
02:02:17,931 --> 02:02:19,829
and all your skills.

1173
02:02:23,464 --> 02:02:26,022
I don't want his mother to see him this way.

1174
02:02:42,499 --> 02:02:45,692
Look how they massacred my boy.

1175
02:03:20,032 --> 02:03:21,259
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1176
02:03:21,499 --> 02:03:24,794
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

1177
02:04:56,799 --> 02:04:59,060
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1178
02:05:00,399 --> 02:05:01,922
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1179
02:05:02,099 --> 02:05:04,826
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1180
02:05:05,098 --> 02:05:08,121
Take her to her father's house
till I know things are safe.

1181
02:05:08,565 --> 02:05:10,190
Anything you say, boss.

1182
02:06:19,732 --> 02:06:21,357
Don Barzini, I want to thank you...

1183
02:06:21,565 --> 02:06:25,191
for helping me organize this meeting here today.

1184
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:28,588
And also the other heads of the five families...

1185
02:06:28,799 --> 02:06:31,128
from New York and New Jersey.

1186
02:06:32,099 --> 02:06:34,792
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1187
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:38,957
From Brooklyn...

1188
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:41,892
Philip Tattaglia.

1189
02:06:44,166 --> 02:06:46,563
And from Staten Island...

1190
02:06:47,133 --> 02:06:50,361
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1191
02:06:50,566 --> 02:06:52,827
And all the other associates that came as far...

1192
02:06:52,966 --> 02:06:56,126
as from California and Kansas City...

1193
02:06:56,365 --> 02:06:58,991
and all the other territories of the country.

1194
02:06:59,166 --> 02:07:00,632
Thank you.

1195
02:07:06,799 --> 02:07:09,027
How did things ever get so far?

1196
02:07:10,366 --> 02:07:12,059
I don't know.

1197
02:07:14,033 --> 02:07:17,863
It was so unfortunate and so unnecessary.

1198
02:07:20,566 --> 02:07:22,827
Tattaglia lost a son...

1199
02:07:23,066 --> 02:07:24,861
and I lost a son.

1200
02:07:26,566 --> 02:07:29,259
We're quits, and ifTattaglia agrees...

1201
02:07:30,099 --> 02:07:34,429
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1202
02:07:35,566 --> 02:07:38,463
We are all grateful to don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1203
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:41,427
We all know him as a man of his word.

1204
02:07:41,999 --> 02:07:44,556
A modest man. He'll always listen to reason.

1205
02:07:44,732 --> 02:07:46,562
Yes, don Barzini.

1206
02:07:46,733 --> 02:07:48,630
He's too modest.

1207
02:07:48,899 --> 02:07:52,093
He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket.

1208
02:07:53,265 --> 02:07:55,562
He refused to share them.

1209
02:07:56,166 --> 02:07:59,132
When did I ever refuse an accommodation?

1210
02:07:59,966 --> 02:08:02,330
All of you know me here.

1211
02:08:03,266 --> 02:08:06,494
When did I ever refuse, except one time?

1212
02:08:07,533 --> 02:08:09,226
And why?

1213
02:08:10,033 --> 02:08:12,625
Because I believe this drug business...

1214
02:08:12,867 --> 02:08:15,594
is gonna destroy us in the years to come.

1215
02:08:16,033 --> 02:08:20,261
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1216
02:08:20,466 --> 02:08:22,591
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1217
02:08:22,767 --> 02:08:26,096
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1218
02:08:26,433 --> 02:08:29,093
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1219
02:08:29,366 --> 02:08:30,991
with gambling and other things...

1220
02:08:31,266 --> 02:08:34,290
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1221
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:38,327
And I believed that then...

1222
02:08:38,633 --> 02:08:40,689
and I believe that now.

1223
02:08:40,899 --> 02:08:42,832
Times have changed.

1224
02:08:43,034 --> 02:08:45,192
It's not like the old days...

1225
02:08:45,366 --> 02:08:47,696
when we could do anything we want.

1226
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:50,525
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1227
02:08:50,832 --> 02:08:54,356
If don Corleone had all the judges
and politicians in New York...

1228
02:08:54,867 --> 02:08:57,799
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1229
02:08:57,967 --> 02:09:00,932
He must let us draw the water from the well.

1230
02:09:01,966 --> 02:09:04,990
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1231
02:09:05,732 --> 02:09:08,927
After all, we are not Communists.

1232
02:09:11,466 --> 02:09:14,024
I also don't believe in drugs.

1233
02:09:14,566 --> 02:09:16,827
For years, I paid my people extra...

1234
02:09:17,033 --> 02:09:19,522
so they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1235
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:22,598
Somebody comes to them and says, I have powders.

1236
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:25,789
If you put up a three,
four-thousand-dollar investment...

1237
02:09:26,566 --> 02:09:29,589
we can make 50,000 distributing.

1238
02:09:30,167 --> 02:09:33,690
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1239
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:36,532
to keep it respectable.

1240
02:09:36,766 --> 02:09:39,961
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1241
02:09:41,334 --> 02:09:43,265
That's an infamia.

1242
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:47,992
In my city, we'll keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1243
02:09:48,366 --> 02:09:51,265
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1244
02:09:58,366 --> 02:10:01,527
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1245
02:10:03,266 --> 02:10:06,392
As a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1246
02:10:06,567 --> 02:10:10,055
to find a peaceful solution to these problems.

1247
02:10:10,366 --> 02:10:12,026
Then we are agreed.

1248
02:10:12,267 --> 02:10:14,824
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted but controlled.

1249
02:10:15,067 --> 02:10:17,533
Don Corleone will give us
protection in the east...

1250
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,625
and there will be the peace.

1251
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:22,665
But I must have strict assurance from Corleone.

1252
02:10:23,333 --> 02:10:26,527
As time goes by and his position becomes stronger...

1253
02:10:26,733 --> 02:10:29,062
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1254
02:10:29,233 --> 02:10:31,291
Look, we are all reasonable men here.

1255
02:10:31,467 --> 02:10:33,762
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1256
02:10:34,867 --> 02:10:36,958
You talk about vengeance.

1257
02:10:37,601 --> 02:10:40,293
Is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you?

1258
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:43,123
Or my boy to me?

1259
02:10:43,801 --> 02:10:46,493
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1260
02:10:49,333 --> 02:10:51,526
But I have selfish reasons.

1261
02:10:53,868 --> 02:10:55,696
My youngest son...

1262
02:10:55,867 --> 02:10:57,833
was forced to leave this country...

1263
02:10:59,334 --> 02:11:01,765
because of this Sollozzo business.

1264
02:11:02,234 --> 02:11:04,756
All right. And I have to make arrangements...

1265
02:11:04,933 --> 02:11:09,161
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1266
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,663
But I'm a superstitious man.

1267
02:11:14,667 --> 02:11:17,132
And if some unlucky accident should befall him...

1268
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:20,028
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1269
02:11:21,466 --> 02:11:24,729
or if he should hang himself in his jail cell...

1270
02:11:25,068 --> 02:11:27,533
of if he's struck by a bolt of lightening...

1271
02:11:29,234 --> 02:11:32,496
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1272
02:11:34,401 --> 02:11:36,923
And that I do not forgive.

1273
02:11:39,167 --> 02:11:41,564
But that aside...

1274
02:11:44,734 --> 02:11:46,995
let me say that I swear...

1275
02:11:48,701 --> 02:11:51,133
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1276
02:11:51,967 --> 02:11:55,730
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1277
02:12:21,801 --> 02:12:23,993
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1278
02:12:24,167 --> 02:12:26,633
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1279
02:12:27,268 --> 02:12:29,597
Mention it. Don't insist.

1280
02:12:31,667 --> 02:12:34,462
Barzini is a man who'll know that without being told.

1281
02:12:35,367 --> 02:12:37,197
You mean Tattaglia.

1282
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:39,929
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1283
02:12:41,068 --> 02:12:43,590
He never could've outfought Santino.

1284
02:12:46,801 --> 02:12:49,426
But I didn't know until this day that it was...

1285
02:12:50,601 --> 02:12:52,430
Barzini all along.

1286
02:13:07,834 --> 02:13:09,595
Come on, Nancy.

1287
02:13:10,934 --> 02:13:13,230
Keep together, everyone. Brian?

1288
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,460
All right.

1289
02:13:29,867 --> 02:13:31,663
How long have you been back?

1290
02:13:32,567 --> 02:13:34,227
I've been back a year.

1291
02:13:35,901 --> 02:13:37,833
Longer than that, I think.

1292
02:13:40,667 --> 02:13:42,496
It's good to see you, Kay.

1293
02:13:49,101 --> 02:13:51,089
Hi, Miss Adams!

1294
02:13:54,001 --> 02:13:55,898
I'm working for my father now.

1295
02:13:59,001 --> 02:14:00,728
He's been sick.

1296
02:14:01,067 --> 02:14:02,966
Very sick.

1297
02:14:03,467 --> 02:14:04,728
But you're not like him.

1298
02:14:05,468 --> 02:14:08,161
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1299
02:14:08,367 --> 02:14:10,061
That's what you told me.

1300
02:14:11,367 --> 02:14:14,266
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1301
02:14:15,769 --> 02:14:20,360
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1302
02:14:20,535 --> 02:14:22,898
Like a senator or a president.

1303
02:14:23,068 --> 02:14:25,432
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1304
02:14:25,602 --> 02:14:27,965
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1305
02:14:31,435 --> 02:14:33,491
Who's being naive?

1306
02:14:34,667 --> 02:14:36,895
My father's way of doing things is over.

1307
02:14:37,067 --> 02:14:39,727
It's finished. Even he knows that.

1308
02:14:40,568 --> 02:14:42,499
I mean, in five years the Corleone family...

1309
02:14:42,734 --> 02:14:45,724
is going to be completely legitimate.

1310
02:14:46,735 --> 02:14:49,825
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1311
02:14:52,135 --> 02:14:54,328
Why did you come here?

1312
02:14:54,501 --> 02:14:56,195
Why?

1313
02:14:56,835 --> 02:14:57,822
What do you want with me after all this time...

1314
02:14:59,135 --> 02:15:01,397
without even calling or writing?

1315
02:15:01,568 --> 02:15:03,556
I came here because I need you.

1316
02:15:03,734 --> 02:15:05,859
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it.

1317
02:15:06,268 --> 02:15:10,462
Because I want you to marry me.

1318
02:15:10,668 --> 02:15:12,759
- It's too late.
- Please.

1319
02:15:14,934 --> 02:15:20,094
I'll do anything you ask to make up
for what's happened to us.

1320
02:15:20,768 --> 02:15:22,997
Because that's important.

1321
02:15:23,201 --> 02:15:25,894
Because what's important is that...

1322
02:15:26,402 --> 02:15:28,300
we have each other.

1323
02:15:28,467 --> 02:15:30,797
That we have a life together.

1324
02:15:31,235 --> 02:15:34,326
That we have children... our children.

1325
02:15:36,802 --> 02:15:38,858
I need you...

1326
02:15:39,734 --> 02:15:42,360
and I love you.

1327
02:16:03,602 --> 02:16:05,295
Barzini's people chisel my territory...

1328
02:16:05,468 --> 02:16:07,093
and we do nothing about it.

1329
02:16:07,268 --> 02:16:09,893
Soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1330
02:16:10,068 --> 02:16:12,296
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help.

1331
02:16:12,502 --> 02:16:15,093
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1332
02:16:15,368 --> 02:16:17,231
We gotta protect ourselves.

1333
02:16:17,568 --> 02:16:19,228
Give me a chance to recruit some new men.

1334
02:16:19,468 --> 02:16:20,763
No.

1335
02:16:21,168 --> 02:16:23,498
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1336
02:16:23,668 --> 02:16:25,530
Mike, you're wrong.

1337
02:16:26,201 --> 02:16:29,793
Don Corleone, you once said the day would come...

1338
02:16:29,969 --> 02:16:32,196
when Tessio and me could form our own family.

1339
02:16:32,668 --> 02:16:34,531
Till today, I would never think of it.

1340
02:16:34,702 --> 02:16:36,894
I must ask your permission.

1341
02:16:37,802 --> 02:16:40,394
Well, Michael is now head of the family...

1342
02:16:40,568 --> 02:16:43,432
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1343
02:16:45,036 --> 02:16:47,126
After we make the move to Nevada...

1344
02:16:47,301 --> 02:16:49,859
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1345
02:16:50,502 --> 02:16:52,933
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1346
02:16:54,769 --> 02:16:56,235
Six months.

1347
02:16:56,468 --> 02:16:58,696
Forgive me, Godfather, but with you gone...

1348
02:17:02,802 --> 02:17:04,700
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1349
02:17:04,969 --> 02:17:07,833
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1350
02:17:08,335 --> 02:17:11,166
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1351
02:17:11,436 --> 02:17:14,094
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1352
02:17:14,335 --> 02:17:16,029
Then be a friend to Michael...

1353
02:17:16,469 --> 02:17:18,627
and do as he says.

1354
02:17:22,568 --> 02:17:24,591
There are things being negotiated
that are gonna solve...

1355
02:17:24,869 --> 02:17:27,335
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1356
02:17:27,868 --> 02:17:30,199
That's all I can tell you now.

1357
02:17:31,169 --> 02:17:32,929
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1358
02:17:33,735 --> 02:17:36,167
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1359
02:17:37,236 --> 02:17:39,258
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1360
02:17:39,735 --> 02:17:42,065
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1361
02:17:42,236 --> 02:17:44,667
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1362
02:17:44,869 --> 02:17:46,460
Besides, if I ever need help...

1363
02:17:46,668 --> 02:17:48,725
who's a better consigliere than my father?

1364
02:17:48,935 --> 02:17:50,662
That's it.

1365
02:18:09,668 --> 02:18:11,861
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1366
02:18:13,503 --> 02:18:16,196
Why am I out?

1367
02:18:17,835 --> 02:18:19,994
You're not a wartime consigliere.

1368
02:18:21,802 --> 02:18:24,393
Things may get rough with the move we're trying.

1369
02:18:31,668 --> 02:18:33,601
I advised Michael.

1370
02:18:33,869 --> 02:18:36,699
I never thought you were a bad consigliere.

1371
02:18:37,069 --> 02:18:40,001
I thought Santino was a bad don...

1372
02:18:40,235 --> 02:18:42,065
rest in peace.

1373
02:18:42,469 --> 02:18:45,593
Michael has all my confidence, as you do.

1374
02:18:46,802 --> 02:18:50,461
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1375
02:18:50,635 --> 02:18:52,533
of what is going to happen.

1376
02:18:52,735 --> 02:18:54,258
Maybe I could help.

1377
02:18:54,436 --> 02:18:56,061
You're out.

1378
02:19:45,336 --> 02:19:47,563
I can't get over the way your face looks.

1379
02:19:47,735 --> 02:19:50,463
It really looks good. This doctor did some job.

1380
02:19:51,169 --> 02:19:53,634
Who talked you into it, Kay? Hey, hey, wait.

1381
02:19:54,036 --> 02:19:56,003
Leave them out here. We'll deal with them later.

1382
02:19:56,169 --> 02:19:57,725
He's tired. He wants to clean up.

1383
02:19:57,902 --> 02:19:59,493
Now, let me open the door.

1384
02:20:07,503 --> 02:20:09,162
Hello, Mike. Welcome to Las Vegas.

1385
02:20:10,669 --> 02:20:12,295
All for you, kid. It was all his idea, right?

1386
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:14,128
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1387
02:20:19,536 --> 02:20:22,094
I'll be right back. You keep them occupied.

1388
02:20:22,270 --> 02:20:24,599
That a boy. Anything you want, kid.

1389
02:20:25,302 --> 02:20:27,064
Who are the girls?

1390
02:20:28,137 --> 02:20:29,829
That's for you to find out.

1391
02:20:29,935 --> 02:20:31,299
Get rid of them.

1392
02:20:33,070 --> 02:20:34,467
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business.

1393
02:20:34,669 --> 02:20:39,033
I leave tomorrow. Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1394
02:20:39,236 --> 02:20:41,225
Get rid of the band too.

1395
02:20:46,536 --> 02:20:49,627
Hey, just take off. Come on. Let's go.

1396
02:20:49,935 --> 02:20:52,129
Hey, that's it. Angelo, that's it.

1397
02:20:52,803 --> 02:20:54,564
Let's go. Hey, come on!

1398
02:20:54,735 --> 02:20:56,361
Scram!

1399
02:20:57,536 --> 02:20:59,899
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1400
02:21:00,202 --> 02:21:01,293
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him.

1401
02:21:01,503 --> 02:21:03,628
It's all right, Freddy.

1402
02:21:04,303 --> 02:21:06,564
I don't know. He's tired, he's hot.

1403
02:21:13,836 --> 02:21:15,994
What happened to Moe Greene?

1404
02:21:16,970 --> 02:21:19,334
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1405
02:21:19,570 --> 02:21:21,228
when the party started.

1406
02:21:21,469 --> 02:21:23,129
Well, give him a call.

1407
02:21:24,703 --> 02:21:27,794
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello. Nice to see you again.

1408
02:21:27,970 --> 02:21:30,027
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1409
02:21:30,237 --> 02:21:31,964
Sit down, Johnny. I want to talk to you.

1410
02:21:32,436 --> 02:21:35,868
- The don's proud of you too.
- I owe it all to him.

1411
02:21:37,136 --> 02:21:38,966
Well, he knows how grateful you are.

1412
02:21:39,137 --> 02:21:41,932
That's why he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1413
02:21:42,202 --> 02:21:44,260
Mike, what can I do?

1414
02:21:45,504 --> 02:21:48,026
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1415
02:21:48,203 --> 02:21:50,635
in the olive oil business, settling out here.

1416
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:54,930
Now, Moe Greene will sell us
his share of the casino and hotel...

1417
02:21:55,137 --> 02:21:57,102
so it can be completely owned by the family.

1418
02:21:57,836 --> 02:21:59,927
Mike, are you sure about that?

1419
02:22:00,137 --> 02:22:00,535
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1420
02:22:03,070 --> 02:22:05,332
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1421
02:22:07,069 --> 02:22:08,501
See, Johnny...

1422
02:22:09,703 --> 02:22:11,795
we figure that entertainment will be a big factor...

1423
02:22:12,002 --> 02:22:13,832
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1424
02:22:14,003 --> 02:22:17,059
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1425
02:22:20,537 --> 02:22:23,991
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1426
02:22:24,170 --> 02:22:25,659
to do the same.

1427
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:27,995
We're counting on you.

1428
02:22:30,570 --> 02:22:33,127
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for my godfather.

1429
02:22:33,336 --> 02:22:34,495
You know that.

1430
02:22:34,669 --> 02:22:35,896
Good.

1431
02:22:37,404 --> 02:22:39,267
Hey, Mike. Hello, fellas.

1432
02:22:39,436 --> 02:22:43,300
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1433
02:22:43,469 --> 02:22:45,436
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1434
02:22:45,636 --> 02:22:48,101
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1435
02:22:48,269 --> 02:22:49,701
and your credit is good.

1436
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:52,063
Draw chips for everybody in the
room so they can play on the house.

1437
02:22:56,203 --> 02:22:57,635
My credit good enough to buy you out?

1438
02:23:00,537 --> 02:23:01,662
Buy me out?

1439
02:23:02,437 --> 02:23:04,459
The casino. The hotel.

1440
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:06,795
The Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1441
02:23:08,137 --> 02:23:10,602
The Corleone family wants to buy me out?

1442
02:23:11,103 --> 02:23:13,399
No, I buy you out. You don't buy me out.

1443
02:23:13,704 --> 02:23:16,602
Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better.

1444
02:23:17,103 --> 02:23:19,002
You think I'm skimming off the top?

1445
02:23:20,170 --> 02:23:22,068
You're unlucky.

1446
02:23:25,836 --> 02:23:28,325
You goddamn guineas really make me laugh.

1447
02:23:28,504 --> 02:23:31,231
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1448
02:23:31,404 --> 02:23:33,336
- Then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1449
02:23:34,270 --> 02:23:36,202
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1450
02:23:36,437 --> 02:23:38,835
bankrolled your casino because
the Molinari family...

1451
02:23:39,004 --> 02:23:41,196
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1452
02:23:41,404 --> 02:23:43,165
Now, we're talkin' business. Let's talk business.

1453
02:23:43,337 --> 02:23:45,996
Let's talk business. First of all, you're all done.

1454
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:48,500
The Corleone family don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1455
02:23:48,704 --> 02:23:51,033
The Godfather's sick. You're
getting chased out of New York...

1456
02:23:51,203 --> 02:23:53,032
by Barzini and the other families.

1457
02:23:53,203 --> 02:23:56,294
You think you can come to my hotel and take over?

1458
02:23:57,137 --> 02:23:58,694
I talked to Barzini.

1459
02:23:58,871 --> 02:24:01,166
I can make a deal with him and still keep my hotel.

1460
02:24:02,103 --> 02:24:04,467
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1461
02:24:06,037 --> 02:24:07,469
That was nothin'.

1462
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:10,502
Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1463
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:12,568
Sure he flies off the handle once in a while...

1464
02:24:13,003 --> 02:24:14,867
but Moe and me, we're good friends, right?

1465
02:24:15,238 --> 02:24:16,998
I got a business to run.

1466
02:24:17,170 --> 02:24:19,693
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1467
02:24:19,871 --> 02:24:22,359
We had a little argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1468
02:24:23,937 --> 02:24:26,062
You straightened my brother out?

1469
02:24:26,703 --> 02:24:29,135
He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time!

1470
02:24:29,470 --> 02:24:32,561
Players couldn't get a drink.
What's wrong with you?

1471
02:24:38,170 --> 02:24:41,534
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1472
02:24:41,970 --> 02:24:43,630
Son of a bitch.

1473
02:24:43,871 --> 02:24:46,497
Do you know who I am? I'm Moe Greene.

1474
02:24:46,704 --> 02:24:49,135
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1475
02:24:49,337 --> 02:24:51,167
Wait a minute. I got an idea.

1476
02:24:52,803 --> 02:24:55,861
Tom, you're the consigliere.
You can talk to the don.

1477
02:24:56,038 --> 02:24:57,730
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1478
02:24:58,070 --> 02:25:01,559
The don is semi retired. Mike is
in charge of the business now.

1479
02:25:01,871 --> 02:25:04,496
If you have anything to say, say it to Michael.

1480
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:13,359
You don't come to Las Vegas
and talk to Moe Greene like that!

1481
02:25:18,137 --> 02:25:20,569
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1482
02:25:22,371 --> 02:25:24,336
But don't ever take sides with anyone...

1483
02:25:24,570 --> 02:25:26,832
against the family again...

1484
02:25:27,904 --> 02:25:29,733
ever.

1485
02:25:37,104 --> 02:25:38,898
I have to see my father and his people.

1486
02:25:39,070 --> 02:25:40,366
Have dinner without me.

1487
02:25:42,904 --> 02:25:44,995
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to the city.

1488
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:47,932
We'll see a show and have dinner. I promise.

1489
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:58,164
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1490
02:25:58,338 --> 02:26:00,303
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1491
02:26:00,470 --> 02:26:03,062
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1492
02:26:03,505 --> 02:26:05,299
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1493
02:26:05,470 --> 02:26:07,130
Let me think about it. Come on.

1494
02:26:14,538 --> 02:26:15,935
So...

1495
02:26:16,570 --> 02:26:19,059
Barzini will move against you first.

1496
02:26:19,671 --> 02:26:22,602
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1497
02:26:24,104 --> 02:26:26,161
guaranteeing your safety.

1498
02:26:27,338 --> 02:26:29,702
And at that meeting, you'll be assassinated.

1499
02:26:35,304 --> 02:26:37,929
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1500
02:26:39,605 --> 02:26:41,570
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1501
02:26:41,871 --> 02:26:43,428
It's good for you, Pop.

1502
02:26:48,238 --> 02:26:49,534
I don't know.

1503
02:26:51,704 --> 02:26:54,034
Your wife and children, are you happy with them?

1504
02:26:55,571 --> 02:26:56,934
Very happy.

1505
02:26:57,804 --> 02:26:59,327
That's good.

1506
02:27:00,405 --> 02:27:02,337
I hope you don't mind the way I...

1507
02:27:02,570 --> 02:27:05,162
I keep going over this Barzini business.

1508
02:27:05,338 --> 02:27:07,099
No, not at all.

1509
02:27:07,404 --> 02:27:09,234
It's an old habit.

1510
02:27:09,837 --> 02:27:12,428
I spent my life tryin' not to be careless.

1511
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:17,326
Women and children can be
careless, but not men.

1512
02:27:20,938 --> 02:27:23,233
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1513
02:27:23,570 --> 02:27:25,935
You know, he looks more like you every day.

1514
02:27:28,971 --> 02:27:31,335
He's smarter than I am.

1515
02:27:31,505 --> 02:27:33,732
Three years old, he can read the funny papers.

1516
02:27:35,505 --> 02:27:37,800
He reads the funny papers.

1517
02:27:44,804 --> 02:27:47,135
I want you to arrange to have a telephone man...

1518
02:27:47,304 --> 02:27:50,930
check all the calls that go in and out of here.

1519
02:27:51,104 --> 02:27:52,536
- I did it already.
- Could be anyone.

1520
02:27:52,705 --> 02:27:56,034
- I took care of that.
- That's right. I forgot.

1521
02:27:59,971 --> 02:28:01,665
What's the matter?

1522
02:28:02,505 --> 02:28:04,630
What's bothering you?

1523
02:28:08,039 --> 02:28:09,697
I'll handle it.

1524
02:28:10,471 --> 02:28:13,063
I told you I can handle it, I'll handle it.

1525
02:28:26,171 --> 02:28:29,762
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1526
02:28:30,471 --> 02:28:32,130
and Fredo...

1527
02:28:32,371 --> 02:28:33,928
Well...

1528
02:28:34,937 --> 02:28:37,199
Fredo was...

1529
02:28:38,838 --> 02:28:41,895
But I never wanted this for you.

1530
02:28:43,838 --> 02:28:46,668
I worked my whole life... I don't apologize...

1531
02:28:46,838 --> 02:28:48,997
to take care of my family...

1532
02:28:49,172 --> 02:28:52,160
and I refused to be a fool...

1533
02:28:53,072 --> 02:28:57,163
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1534
02:28:59,239 --> 02:29:01,033
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1535
02:29:04,305 --> 02:29:06,634
that when it was your time...

1536
02:29:07,038 --> 02:29:10,936
you would be the one to hold the strings.

1537
02:29:11,471 --> 02:29:14,370
Senator Corleone.

1538
02:29:14,805 --> 02:29:17,032
Governor Corleone. Something.

1539
02:29:17,204 --> 02:29:19,830
Another pezzonovante.

1540
02:29:25,039 --> 02:29:28,062
Just wasn't enough time. Wasn't enough time.

1541
02:29:28,938 --> 02:29:30,995
We'll get there, Pop.

1542
02:29:31,571 --> 02:29:33,696
We'll get there.

1543
02:29:37,471 --> 02:29:40,904
Listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1544
02:29:41,773 --> 02:29:43,601
he's the traitor.

1545
02:29:43,772 --> 02:29:45,363
Don't forget that.

1546
02:30:02,139 --> 02:30:03,798
Put it over the tree.

1547
02:30:19,471 --> 02:30:21,529
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1548
02:30:21,872 --> 02:30:23,168
That's fine.

1549
02:30:23,338 --> 02:30:25,668
Over here. Over here.

1550
02:30:27,839 --> 02:30:30,134
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1551
02:30:36,672 --> 02:30:39,603
Anthony, come here.

1552
02:30:42,906 --> 02:30:46,394
Go ahead. That's right. We'll put it right there.

1553
02:30:53,506 --> 02:30:55,801
I'll show you something. Come here.

1554
02:30:57,972 --> 02:30:59,665
Now, you stand there.

1555
02:31:03,472 --> 02:31:05,131
Give me an orange!

1556
02:31:23,906 --> 02:31:25,202
That's a new trick.

1557
02:31:26,605 --> 02:31:28,504
You run in there. Run in there.

1558
02:31:42,472 --> 02:31:44,438
- Where are you?
- Who?

1559
02:31:44,606 --> 02:31:45,867
Ouch!

1560
02:34:41,873 --> 02:34:43,634
Mike, can I have a minute?

1561
02:34:54,373 --> 02:34:56,464
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1562
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:59,397
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1563
02:35:00,907 --> 02:35:02,633
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1564
02:35:04,306 --> 02:35:05,897
I can arrange security...

1565
02:35:06,774 --> 02:35:08,671
on my territory.

1566
02:35:11,173 --> 02:35:12,571
All right?

1567
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:15,638
- All right.
- All right.

1568
02:35:31,373 --> 02:35:33,306
Do you know how they're gonna come at you?

1569
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:39,135
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.

1570
02:35:39,306 --> 02:35:41,067
Tessio's ground...

1571
02:35:42,573 --> 02:35:44,562
where I'll be safe.

1572
02:35:56,774 --> 02:35:59,070
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1573
02:36:00,373 --> 02:36:01,999
It's the smart move.

1574
02:36:02,740 --> 02:36:04,796
Tessio was always smarter.

1575
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:08,866
But I'm gonna wait.

1576
02:36:09,041 --> 02:36:10,938
After the baptism.

1577
02:36:13,174 --> 02:36:16,333
I've decided to be godfather to Connie's baby.

1578
02:36:17,173 --> 02:36:19,799
And then I'll meet with don Barzini...

1579
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:25,266
all the heads of the five families.

1580
02:38:47,307 --> 02:38:49,364
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father Almighty...

1581
02:38:49,574 --> 02:38:52,768
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1582
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:54,201
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1583
02:38:56,374 --> 02:38:57,397
I do.

1584
02:38:57,574 --> 02:39:01,472
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

1585
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:02,867
I do.

1586
02:40:09,041 --> 02:40:12,769
Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan?

1587
02:40:19,408 --> 02:40:21,034
I do renounce him.

1588
02:40:30,408 --> 02:40:31,840
And all his works?

1589
02:40:45,408 --> 02:40:46,999
I do renounce them.

1590
02:40:52,474 --> 02:40:55,929
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1591
02:41:11,941 --> 02:41:16,033
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?

1592
02:41:16,207 --> 02:41:17,571
I will.

1593
02:41:24,875 --> 02:41:27,340
Michael Rizzi, go in peace.

1594
02:41:27,574 --> 02:41:30,370
And may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1595
02:42:12,541 --> 02:42:14,474
- Carlo.
- What?

1596
02:42:14,675 --> 02:42:16,538
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come up.

1597
02:42:16,709 --> 02:42:18,697
Everybody's gonna have to leave without us.

1598
02:42:19,175 --> 02:42:21,403
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1599
02:42:21,609 --> 02:42:22,733
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1600
02:42:22,908 --> 02:42:24,840
Wait for my call. It's important.

1601
02:42:26,609 --> 02:42:28,540
I'll only be a couple of days.

1602
02:42:31,575 --> 02:42:33,131
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1603
02:42:44,908 --> 02:42:46,738
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1604
02:42:49,208 --> 02:42:51,538
I hope Mike can get us a good deal tonight.

1605
02:42:51,742 --> 02:42:53,298
I'm sure he will.

1606
02:43:00,742 --> 02:43:03,639
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a separate car.

1607
02:43:03,908 --> 02:43:05,636
He says for you two to go on ahead.

1608
02:43:06,275 --> 02:43:08,707
He can't do that. It screws up all my arrangements.

1609
02:43:08,941 --> 02:43:10,873
- That's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1610
02:43:23,942 --> 02:43:25,873
Tell Mike it was only business.

1611
02:43:26,909 --> 02:43:28,602
I always liked him.

1612
02:43:29,541 --> 02:43:30,565
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1613
02:43:38,509 --> 02:43:40,236
Can you get me off the hook?

1614
02:43:42,142 --> 02:43:44,734
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1615
02:44:30,842 --> 02:44:33,330
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1616
02:44:38,509 --> 02:44:39,941
You got it all wrong.

1617
02:44:40,076 --> 02:44:42,633
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.

1618
02:44:43,375 --> 02:44:46,433
That little farce you played with my sister.

1619
02:44:47,308 --> 02:44:49,172
Did you think that could fool a Corleone?

1620
02:44:49,342 --> 02:44:51,502
I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1621
02:44:52,609 --> 02:44:54,336
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1622
02:44:58,675 --> 02:45:00,504
Don't do this to me, please.

1623
02:45:09,475 --> 02:45:11,305
Barzini's dead.

1624
02:45:13,275 --> 02:45:15,468
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1625
02:45:16,842 --> 02:45:18,467
Moe Greene...

1626
02:45:19,308 --> 02:45:21,366
Strachi...

1627
02:45:22,410 --> 02:45:24,238
Cuneo.

1628
02:45:25,043 --> 02:45:28,134
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent.

1629
02:45:30,343 --> 02:45:32,400
Admit what you did.

1630
02:45:36,009 --> 02:45:38,066
Get him a drink.

1631
02:45:44,175 --> 02:45:45,664
Come on.

1632
02:45:46,609 --> 02:45:48,303
Don't be afraid.

1633
02:45:49,175 --> 02:45:52,199
You think I'd make my sister a widow?

1634
02:45:53,243 --> 02:45:54,640
I'm godfather to your son.

1635
02:46:02,776 --> 02:46:04,072
Go ahead, drink.

1636
02:46:04,343 --> 02:46:05,933
Drink.

1637
02:46:09,777 --> 02:46:11,765
No, you're out of the family business.

1638
02:46:11,976 --> 02:46:15,408
That's your punishment. You're finished.

1639
02:46:15,842 --> 02:46:18,070
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1640
02:46:24,410 --> 02:46:26,807
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1641
02:46:28,076 --> 02:46:30,235
Only don't tell me you're innocent...

1642
02:46:31,942 --> 02:46:34,636
because it insults my intelligence.

1643
02:46:35,044 --> 02:46:37,009
It makes me very angry.

1644
02:46:40,476 --> 02:46:42,668
Now, who approached you?

1645
02:46:43,710 --> 02:46:46,470
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1646
02:46:53,976 --> 02:46:55,909
It was Barzini.

1647
02:46:59,810 --> 02:47:01,208
Good.

1648
02:47:07,543 --> 02:47:10,304
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1649
02:47:11,543 --> 02:47:13,736
I'll call your wife, tell her what flight you're on.

1650
02:47:19,877 --> 02:47:22,637
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1651
02:47:48,243 --> 02:47:49,709
Hello, Carlo.

1652
02:48:47,910 --> 02:48:50,341
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1653
02:48:50,977 --> 02:48:53,943
- I'm telling you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1654
02:49:03,310 --> 02:49:05,003
Where is he?

1655
02:49:08,044 --> 02:49:12,136
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1656
02:49:13,177 --> 02:49:15,336
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1657
02:49:15,544 --> 02:49:16,975
and then you killed him!

1658
02:49:17,209 --> 02:49:20,142
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1659
02:49:20,377 --> 02:49:23,774
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1660
02:49:24,177 --> 02:49:26,438
Now what am I gonna do?

1661
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:32,698
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the mall?

1662
02:49:32,910 --> 02:49:35,138
All the time he knew he was gonna kill him.

1663
02:49:35,943 --> 02:49:38,500
And you stood godfather to our baby.

1664
02:49:38,676 --> 02:49:41,040
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1665
02:49:41,277 --> 02:49:43,334
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1666
02:49:43,576 --> 02:49:45,167
Read the papers! Read the papers!

1667
02:49:45,444 --> 02:49:47,841
That's your husband! That's your husband!

1668
02:50:02,377 --> 02:50:03,933
Take her upstairs.

1669
02:50:04,244 --> 02:50:06,472
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1670
02:50:26,711 --> 02:50:28,505
She's hysterical.

1671
02:50:33,078 --> 02:50:34,804
Hysterical.

1672
02:50:36,611 --> 02:50:38,509
Is it true?

1673
02:50:40,411 --> 02:50:41,468
Don't ask me about my business.

1674
02:50:42,511 --> 02:50:45,772
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1675
02:50:45,977 --> 02:50:47,500
Enough!

1676
02:51:07,044 --> 02:51:08,305
All right.

1677
02:51:11,244 --> 02:51:12,972
This one time.

1678
02:51:16,943 --> 02:51:19,842
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1679
02:51:26,577 --> 02:51:28,009
Is it true?

1680
02:51:32,144 --> 02:51:33,633
Is it?

1681
02:51:50,611 --> 02:51:52,839
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1682
02:51:53,010 --> 02:51:54,374
Come on.

1683
02:52:24,778 --> 02:52:26,835
Don Corleone.
